# optim_compare

This is a package to compare different optimization algorithms using 2D objective functions.  

Simply run this code "OPTIM_VFSA_SPSA_V01.m" and it will find all the dependencies.

Contribution are welcome to include other objective fucntions. Converting the codes to other programming languages are also welcome.

Now the VFSA and SPSA optimizations are included. 

The current objective functions provided are as follows:

sign function 2D with global minimum at(0,0) where f(x, y)=0.0

Banana(Rosen)function with global minimum at(1,1) where f(x, y)=0.0

Griewank function with global minimum at(0,0) where f(x, y)=0.0
